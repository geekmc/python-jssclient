### Command-Line  API
First set three environment variables :
```
export JSS_ACCESS_KEY=<Your-jss-access-key>
export JSS_SECRET_KEY=<Your-jss-secret-key>
export JSS_URL=<HOST-of-JSS-server>:<PORT-of-JSS-server>
```
Of course , you can add above to you `~/.bashrc` file, and then:
```
source ~/.bashrc
```
will make the same effects.

You'll find complete documentation on the shell by running `jss help`:

           [--jss-url JSS_URL]

### Python API
There's also a complete Python API, but it has not yet been documented.

Quick-start using jss-client for python:
```python
>>> from jssclient import client 
>>> JSS_ACCESS_KEY='9c379f079214447fad2959c4621cd6feVb797oH1'     
>>> JSS_SECRET_KEY='5e998dbbafb44ca783099afcdead40fa7A3Vf7Fh'
>>> JSS_URL='192.168.195.63:6080'
>>> cl = client.Client(access_key=JSS_ACCESS_KEY, secret_key=JSS_SECRET_KEY, jss_url=JSS_URL) 
>>> cl.bucket_list() 
[...]
```


### FAQs

1.  `ImportError: No module named pkg_resources` ? 

```shell
    curl -O https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py
    python ez_setup.py
```

2.  when execute `jss bucket-list`, print 

```shell
    ERROR: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'bool' objects" 
```
It means your environment variables did not become effective, you can use Command
to test:
```shell
env  | grep JSS_ACCESS_KEY
```

your need to execute:
```shell
source ~/.bashrc  # or source <path>/jss.rc
```
